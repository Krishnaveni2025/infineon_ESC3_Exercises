There is an assignment on C program sections:
Define a custom section in the ‘main.c’ file with your name.
When ‘main.c’ is compiled into ‘main.o’, this custom section should appear in the ‘objdump’ output of the generated object file.

*Hint:* Use the ‘attribute’ command to create the custom section
