The exemplary microcontroller has 4MB of flash starting at 0x20000000, 128KB of SRAM-1 starting at 0x30000000 and 
32KB of SRAM-2 starting at 0x40000000
‒ You may assume that the compiler generates the following input sections. 
Notice that there is a dot(.) prefixed to the names of the input sections.
‒ .text for the code section 
‒ .data for the initialized data section 
‒ .bss for the uninitialized data section 
‒ .rodata for constant data section
‒ You may also assume that you found a way to instruct the compiler to create a special input section by name .criticaltext

‒ Write a linker script fulfilling the following requirements
‒ IMPORTANT: Learn and understand the concept of Wildcard notation in programming
‒ Describe the memory regions of the microcontroller using MEMORY command‒ FLASH, SRAM1and SRAM2‒ Using SECTIONS command
‒ Create an output section by name .flashsections and assign the .text and .rodata input sections to it
‒ Assign this .flashsections output section to FLASH memory region ‒ Create an output section by name .rwdata and assign the .data and .bss input sections to it
‒ Assign this .rwdata output section to SRAM1 memory region 
‒ Create an output section by name .criticaltext and assign the .criticaltext input section to it [Yes, the names 
of input and output sections are the same] 
‒ Assign this .criticaltext output section to SRAM2 memory region
‒ For each of the input sections, find out how the start
-address of the section and its length can be determined.
‒ HINT : In the examples that you may find on the internet, you will find variables by name sbss, ebss, stext, etext etc.
